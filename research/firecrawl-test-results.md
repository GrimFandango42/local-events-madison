### Cost Driver Analysis

**Where Charges Come From**:
1. **Every URL scrape = 1 credit** (regardless of success/failure)
2. **Failed requests still charged** (Instagram/Facebook failures cost money)
3. **Large pages may cost more credits** (not confirmed in test)
4. **Screenshots add extra credits**
5. **Structured extraction (Extract API) costs more**

### Real Cost Examples from Test

**This Test Session**:
- 5 API calls made
- 2 failures (Instagram/Facebook) = still charged
- 3 successes (example.com, Visit Madison, Isthmus)
- **Total cost**: 5 credits = $0.0027 - $0.027

## Critical Discovery: Social Media Restriction

### üö® Major Finding
**Firecrawl has BLOCKED Facebook and Instagram** at the API level, requiring special account permissions. This is likely due to:
- Terms of service compliance
- Anti-bot protection by social platforms
- Legal risk mitigation by Firecrawl

### Impact on Local Events Platform
- **Cannot use Firecrawl for primary goal** (Facebook/Instagram event scraping)
- **Excellent for regular websites** (government, local media, venues)
- **Need alternative strategy** for social media data

## Performance Assessment

### ‚úÖ What Works Excellently
- **Government sites**: visitmadison.com worked perfectly
- **Local media**: isthmus.com extracted 107 event mentions
- **Response quality**: Clean, structured markdown output
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate for non-social media

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
- **Instagram**: Completely blocked
- **Facebook**: Completely blocked  
- **Social media platforms**: Require special permissions

## Cost Avoidance Strategies

### 1. üîÑ Caching Strategy (70-90% savings)
```typescript
// Cache results for 2-6 hours
const cacheTimeout = 6 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 6 hours
const cachedResult = cache.get(url);
if (cachedResult && Date.now() - cachedResult.timestamp < cacheTimeout) {
  return cachedResult.data; // FREE - no API call
}
```

### 2. üéØ Smart Source Selection (80% savings)
- Use **FREE MCP Playwright** for 80% of sources
- Use **Firecrawl** only for MCP-blocked sources
- Avoid social media entirely (blocked anyway)

### 3. ‚ö° Configuration Optimization (20-40% per request)
```typescript
const optimizedConfig = {
  formats: ['markdown'], // Only needed format
  onlyMainContent: true, // Reduce processing
  timeout: 15000,       // Fast failure
  // Don't use: screenshots, extract, multiple formats
};
```

### 4. ‚è∞ Intelligent Scheduling (50-70% frequency reduction)
- Scrape sources only when content likely changed
- Batch requests during business hours
- Monitor high-value sources more frequently

## Recommended Strategy for Local Events

### Phase 1: Avoid Firecrawl for MVP
**Use MCP Playwright for everything**:
- Government sites: visitmadison.com ‚úÖ
- Local media: isthmus.com ‚úÖ  
- Venue websites: Most work fine ‚úÖ
- Social media: Both tools blocked anyway ‚ùå

**Cost**: $0/month

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (if needed)
**Use Firecrawl only for MCP-blocked sources**:
- Protected venue websites
- Sites with advanced anti-bot detection
- **NOT social media** (blocked anyway)

**Expected cost**: $1-5/month

### Phase 3: Social Media Strategy
Since both Firecrawl and MCP can't reliably access Facebook/Instagram:
1. **Official Instagram Graph API** for business accounts you manage
2. **Direct venue partnerships** for event data feeds
3. **RSS feeds** where available
4. **Manual curation** for high-value sources

## Final Recommendations

### ‚úÖ DO Use Firecrawl For:
- Government event sites (if MCP blocked)
- Protected venue websites
- Sites with complex anti-bot measures
- **NOT social media** (blocked at API level)

### ‚ùå DON'T Use Firecrawl For:
- Facebook pages (blocked)
- Instagram pages (blocked)
- Simple websites (use free MCP instead)
- High-frequency monitoring (too expensive)

### üí° Optimal Local Events Strategy:
1. **Start with MCP Playwright** (free, works for most sources)
2. **Add official APIs** for social media (Instagram Graph API)
3. **Use Firecrawl as last resort** for specific blocked sources
4. **Focus on venue partnerships** instead of scraping

### üìä Expected Results:
- **90% data coverage** through MCP + official APIs
- **$0-5/month cost** vs $15-150/month Firecrawl-only
- **Legal compliance** through official APIs
- **Better reliability** through diverse sources

## Conclusion

Firecrawl is excellent for general web scraping but **cannot access social media platforms** (the primary goal). The hybrid MCP + official API approach provides better coverage at lower cost while maintaining legal compliance.
