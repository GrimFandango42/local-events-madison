# Local Events Platform - Key Research Findings

## Critical Discovery: Facebook API Completely Unavailable

**‚ö†Ô∏è Major Finding**: Facebook Events API was completely discontinued in September 2023. There is NO official way to access Facebook event data, including public pages. Web scraping violates their terms of service and faces advanced anti-bot measures.

**Impact**: Your original plan to access Facebook pages without logging in is technically impossible through official means and legally risky through unofficial means.

## Recommended Alternative Strategy

### Data Sources (Priority Order)
1. **Direct Venue Partnerships** - Most reliable, legal, and sustainable
2. **Local Media Integration** - Isthmus Magazine, Visit Madison calendars
3. **RSS Feeds** - Where available from cooperating venues
4. **Community Submissions** - User-generated content with moderation
5. **Official APIs** - Eventbrite, Meetup for broader coverage

### Madison-Specific Advantages
- **Tight-knit community** makes partnerships feasible
- **Active local media** (Isthmus) with comprehensive event coverage  
- **University presence** provides major event source (UW-Madison)
- **Food/brewery scene** often willing to promote events directly

## Technical Architecture Recommendation

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS + Mapbox
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization for easy deployment

### Three-Phase Approach
1. **MVP (3-4 months)**: Manual curation + basic web scraping of willing sources
2. **Enhancement (2-3 months)**: Partnerships + automation + user features  
3. **Regional (6 months)**: Multi-city expansion + mobile apps + revenue model

## Competitive Landscape Insights

### What Works
- **Local partnerships** over aggressive scraping
- **Clean, visual interfaces** for event discovery
- **Mobile-first design** for on-the-go usage
- **Community features** (saves, sharing, recommendations)

### Common Failures
- **Over-reliance on scraping** leads to britttle systems
- **Complex interfaces** overwhelm users
- **Poor data quality** from automated collection without curation
- **Ignoring legal/ToS issues** until forced to shut down

## Business Model Validation

### Revenue Potential
- **Freemium subscriptions**: $5/month premium tier
- **Venue partnerships**: $25-100/month for promoted listings
- **Event promotion**: $15-50 per featured event

### Market Size
- Madison metro: ~680,000 people
- Target demographic: 25-45 year-olds interested in food/culture
- Estimated TAM: 50,000-100,000 potential users

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks (Mitigated)
- ‚ùå Facebook scraping (AVOID - use partnerships instead)
- ‚ùå Single data source dependency (DIVERSIFY sources)
- ‚ùå Complex technical architecture (START simple)

### Manageable Risks  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User adoption (Start personal, grow organically)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data quality (Manual curation initially)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Competition (Focus on superior UX and local knowledge)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start MVP development** with recommended tech stack
2. **Contact Isthmus Magazine** about partnership/data access
3. **Reach out to 3-5 key venues** about direct event feeds
4. **Build basic admin panel** for manual event curation
5. **Focus on food/music events** in downtown Madison initially

## Success Factors

### Must-Have
- ‚úÖ **Legal data collection** methods only
- ‚úÖ **Mobile-responsive design** for event discovery
- ‚úÖ **Quality over quantity** in event listings
- ‚úÖ **Direct venue relationships** for sustainability

### Nice-to-Have  
- üéØ Advanced personalization features
- üéØ Social sharing and friend connections
- üéØ Push notifications and calendar integration
- üéØ Multi-city expansion capabilities

The research shows this project is absolutely viable, but success depends on building genuine partnerships rather than trying to circumvent Facebook's restrictions. The Madison market is ideal for this approach due to its community-oriented culture and active local scene.
