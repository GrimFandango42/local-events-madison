# Enhanced Prisma Schema - Local Events Platform

This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the Prisma schema to support multi-city deployment, advanced deduplication, federation readiness, and privacy-focused user management.

## üéØ Key Improvements Overview

### 1. **Normalized Neighborhoods System**
- **Problem Solved**: Original schema used a simple string field for neighborhoods
- **Enhancement**: Created dedicated `Neighborhood` model with relationships
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent neighborhood naming across venues
  - Geographic boundary support with GeoJSON polygons
  - Better filtering and search capabilities
  - City-specific neighborhood management

### 2. **Advanced Event Deduplication**
- **Problem Solved**: No systematic way to handle duplicate events from multiple sources
- **Enhancement**: Multi-layer deduplication system with hash-based detection
- **Features**:
  - `deduplicationHash`: Hash of key event properties (title, time, location)
  - `contentHash`: Hash of full content for change detection
  - `titleHash`: Normalized title hash for fuzzy matching
  - `timeLocationHash`: Hash of time + location for venue-based duplicates
  - `DeduplicationStatus` enum: unique, potential, confirmed, merged
  - `canonicalEventId`: Points to master event for merged duplicates
  - `similarityScore`: ML-ready similarity scoring

### 3. **Multi-City Configuration System**
- **Problem Solved**: Hard-coded Madison-specific configuration
- **Enhancement**: Hierarchical Region ‚Üí City ‚Üí Neighborhood structure
- **Features**:
  - **Region Model**: State/country level configuration
  - **City Model**: Complete city-specific customization including:
    - Branding (logos, colors, taglines)
    - Geographic settings (timezone, default radius)
    - Federation settings (ActivityPub support)
    - Contact information
    - Instance configuration
  - Easy forking: New cities can be added with full customization

### 4. **Privacy-Focused User Management**
- **Problem Solved**: Need for user features while maintaining privacy
- **Enhancement**: Minimal data collection with strong privacy controls
- **Features**:
  - Optional email with hashed alternatives for deduplication
  - Anonymous usage by default (`isAnonymous: true`)
  - Explicit consent tracking for data retention and marketing
  - Soft deletion with `deletedAt` for GDPR compliance
  - Pseudonym support for user-chosen display names
  - Fine-grained privacy settings

### 5. **User Subscriptions and Notifications**
- **Enhancement**: Comprehensive subscription system for user engagement
- **Features**:
  - Multiple subscription types: email, push, SMS, RSS, webhooks
  - Granular filtering: categories, neighborhoods, keywords, price ranges
  - Flexible scheduling with timezone support
  - Delivery failure tracking and retry logic
  - User preference management

### 6. **Enhanced Source Management**
- **Problem Solved**: Limited source configuration and monitoring
- **Enhancement**: Professional-grade source management system
- **Features**:
  - City-specific sources for multi-city deployment
  - Advanced scraping configuration with authentication
  - Performance metrics and quality scoring
  - Rate limiting and politeness settings
  - Federation source support (ActivityPub)
  - Community submission and approval workflow

### 7. **Federation Readiness (ActivityPub)**
- **Enhancement**: Built-in support for decentralized event sharing
- **Features**:
  - ActivityPub IDs for events and cities
  - Federation inbox/outbox support
  - Public/private key management for signatures
  - Cross-instance event sharing capability
  - Maintains local control while enabling network effects

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### From Current Schema
1. **Add new models** (Region, City, Neighborhood, User, etc.)
2. **Migrate existing data**:
   - Create default Region and City for Madison
   - Extract neighborhoods from existing venue strings
   - Generate deduplication hashes for existing events
3. **Update foreign keys** to point to City instead of hardcoded values
4. **Backfill missing data** with sensible defaults

### Multi-City Deployment
1. **Create new City record** with custom branding
2. **Import neighborhoods** for the new city
3. **Configure city-specific sources** and venues
4. **Set up federation** if desired
5. **Launch with minimal user data collection**
