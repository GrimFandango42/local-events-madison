2. **Visit Madison** - Official tourism calendar: visitmadison.com/events  
3. **City of Madison** - Parks & special events: cityofmadison.com

## Key Findings

### RSS/API Availability: Limited
- Most venues use standard web calendars without structured feeds
- Wisconsin State Journal offers RSS for news (not events specifically)
- Direct partnerships will be necessary for reliable data

### Best Data Collection Strategy
1. **Manual monitoring** of key websites
2. **Email subscriptions** to venue newsletters  
3. **Direct partnerships** with major venues
4. **Social media monitoring** for real-time updates
5. **Community submissions** through the platform
